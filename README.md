# SLR Crawler

This is a simple crawler that collects references from academic
libraries. 

* It currently supports Google Scholar, ACM, Science Direct,
IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library.
* It produces a CSV with the following columns: _library,title,conference,url,author,year,citations_

## How to use it

First, build a jar:

`mvn clean package`

It creates a jar with all the dependencies. Now, just: 

```
java -jar slr-crawler-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar [options]
```

All the options are:
```
Usage: <main class> [-h] [-b=<browser>] [-d=<storageDir>] [-f=<storageFormat>]
                    -k=<keywords> -n=<stopAt> [-s=<startFrom>]
                    [--springer-content-type=<springerContentType>]
                    [--springer-discipline=<springerDiscipline>]
                    [--springer-sub-discipline=<springerSubDiscipline>]
                    [-t=<seconds>] [-l=<libraries>[,<libraries>...]]...
  -b, --browser=<browser>   Which browser to open for the crawling. You have to
                              configure Selenium's plugin in your machine.
                              Supported 'safari', 'firefox', 'chrome'. Default:
                              'safari'
  -d, --dir=<storageDir>    Directory to store everything. Default: current
                              directory
  -f, --storageFormat=<storageFormat>
                            format to store files. Default=html. Options:
                              'html', 'json'
  -h, --help                display a help message
  -k, --keywords=<keywords> The keywords used in the search
  -l, --libraries=<libraries>[,<libraries>...]
                            Which libraries to use. Currently 'scholar',
                              'ieee', 'acm', 'sciencedirect', 'springer'.
                              Default = all of them
  -n, --stopAt=<stopAt>     The number of the last item to be captured (note
                              that the crawler might return a bit more than
                              specified, depending on the library)
  -s, --startFrom=<startFrom>
                            The number of the first item to start (could be a
                              bit less, depending on the library)
      --springer-content-type=<springerContentType>
                            Springer content-type (check them in the website).
                              Example: 'ConferencePaper'
      --springer-discipline=<springerDiscipline>
                            Springer discipline (check them in the website).
                              Example: 'Computer Science'
      --springer-sub-discipline=<springerSubDiscipline>
                            Springer sub-discipline (check them in the
                              website). Example: 'Software Engineering'
  -t, --time=<seconds>      The number of seconds to wait in between page
                              visits. Good to avoid libraries to block you.
                              Default = 0
```

## Examples

First 500 results for "search-based software testing" in all the libraries, 
2 seconds between visiting pages. (Safari as browser, so you have to be in a Mac).

```
-k "software engineering controlled experiment"
-n 500
-t 2
```
Search for "search-based software testing" in Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore,
the 50 first results (e.g., in Google Scholar, from page 1 to 5, as Scholar gives 
10 results per page), in Firefox.

```
-k "search-based software testing"
-l "scholar,ieee"
-n 50
-d /some/dir
-b firefox
```

Search for "search-based software testing" in Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore,
from result 10 to 50 (e.g., in Google Scholar, from page 2 to 5, as Scholar gives 
10 results per page).

```
-k "search-based software testing"
-l "scholar,ieee"
-s 10
-n 50
-d /some/dir
-b safari
```

Search for "search-based software testing" in Springer,
the 50 first results (e.g., in Google Scholar, from page 1 to 5, as Scholar gives 
10 results per page) only in Computer Science -> Software Engineering, ConferenceÂ papers.

```
-k "search-based software testing"
-l "springer"
-n 50
-d /some/dir
-b safari
--springer-discipline "Computer Science"
--springer-discipline "Software Engineering"
--springer-content-type "ConferencePaper"
```

## Selenium

This tool uses Selenium to visit the webpages. Selenium opens the browser
in your machine. Unfortunately, HtmlUnit does not work for some of the websites;
it has to be a real browser.

* If you are using Mac, just go for "Safari", and everything will work.
* If you are not using Mac, go for "firefox" or "chrome". For Chrome,
you have to download the [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
and set _webdriver.chrome.driver_ global path to the Chrome Driver. Check
Selenium's documentation on how to make it work in your platform.  

## Caveats

* It does not collect citation numbers from Springer and ScienceDirect,
as these numbers are not available in the search page.
* In Google Scholar, it only collects the name of the first author. Google
truncates large lists of authors.
